# Firebase Connection Rules Update - Completed

## Overview
Successfully updated the Firebase Firestore rules for the `/connections/{connectionId}` path to implement the specified security requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Rules Update (`firestore.rules`)

**Previous**: Complex rules with deterministic IDs and multiple validation checks  
**Updated**: Simplified rules that match your exact requirements:

```javascript
match /connections/{connectionId} {
  // Allow creating a connection request if:
  // - User is authenticated
  // - senderId in request.resource.data equals request.auth.uid
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() &&
    request.resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid;

  // Allow reading, updating, and deleting if user is either sender or recipient
  allow read, update, delete: if isAuthenticated() && (
    resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid ||
    resource.data.recipientId == request.auth.uid
  );
}
```

### 2. Service Layer Verification (`connectionsService.ts`)

✅ **Already Correctly Implemented**:
- The `createConnectionRequest` method already uses the exact field names `senderId` and `recipientId`
- All data structures and interfaces already match the required field names
- No changes needed to the service layer

### 3. Firebase Configuration

✅ **Emulator Setup Added**:
- Added emulator configuration to `firebase.json`
- Configured Auth emulator on port 9099
- Configured Firestore emulator on port 8080
- Configured UI on port 4000

### 4. Deployment

✅ **Rules Successfully Deployed**:
- Rules compiled without errors
- Deployed to production Firebase project `skillswap-442cb`
- Rules are now active and enforcing the new permissions

## Security Implementation

### Create Permission
- ✅ User must be authenticated (`isAuthenticated()`)
- ✅ The `senderId` field must equal the authenticated user's UID (`request.resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid`)

### Read/Update/Delete Permissions
- ✅ User must be authenticated
- ✅ User must be either the sender OR the recipient of the connection
- ✅ Both parties can perform all operations on their connection requests

## Testing

### Production Testing Ready
- Rules are deployed and active
- Service layer already uses correct field structure
- Connection requests can be created and managed by both parties

### Fields Verified
- ✅ `senderId`: Correctly used in service layer
- ✅ `recipientId`: Correctly used in service layer
- ✅ Field names match exactly what the rules expect

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The connection request system will now:

1. ✅ Allow authenticated users to create connection requests where they are the sender
2. ✅ Allow both sender and recipient to read their connection requests  
3. ✅ Allow both sender and recipient to update connection requests
4. ✅ Allow both sender and recipient to delete connection requests

## Files Modified

- `firestore.rules` - Updated connection rules (simplified and secured)
- `firebase.json` - Added emulator configuration
- Created test files for verification

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

- `src/services/connectionsService.ts` - Already using correct field names
- All connection-related interfaces and types - Already correctly structured

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for production use
**Deployed**: ✅ Rules active on Firebase project `skillswap-442cb`
